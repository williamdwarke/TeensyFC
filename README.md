# TeensyFC

An open-source, research-oriented flight control platform.

Warning: This repository is in its early stages and the code has only been tested on a single quadrotor I built. I still need to finish cleaning it up and documenting it as well as write a complete guide to my hardware implementation which I am planning on open-sourcing as well. I am also working on tying it in with ROS!

Please come again soon, as I am continuing to make progress on this throughout my academic career.
